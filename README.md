# Dasmotos Arts & Crafts

This project is a Code Academy project where I created a website for a fictional arts and crafts store on my own computer using a design spec.

I used HTML and CSS.

What I've practiced/learned:
- Following a design spec to create the website - You can check the design spec [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg?_gl=1*oc6anj*_ga*NTEzNzQzNDM5OS4xNjY4MTYyMTI4*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3MDQyMzY4My40NC4xLjE2NzA0MjM3MDIuMC4wLjA.);
- Span (HTML);
- Create a general class bold (HTML / CSS);
- Background image (CSS).
